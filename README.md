# PIP-CO Startup Systems

A modular custom-startup holotape for The Wand Company Pip-Boy 3000. Select a startup sequence in the holotape, then the selected animation is used on the next Pip-Boy boot/wake.

## Pip-Boy.com modular installation

The core installs automatically. Each startup AVI is optional, so users can install only the startup sequences they want. Audio is embedded in each AVI; there are no separate startup WAV dependencies. The holotape only shows startups whose AVI is installed.

## Runtime / compatibility notes

Version 1.1.0 uses a small persistent startup service separated from the holotape menu/UI. This prevents the startup hook from retaining the full menu, title, and scroller closure after the holotape closes. The change was made after repeated hardware testing exposed `CALLBACK`, `LOW_MEMORY`, and `MEMORY` failures on Pip-Boy OS 1.1.6.

The hard-failsafe timer now begins after `Pip.videoStart()` succeeds, so firmware/pre-play delays do not consume the startup's playback window. Event-ended startup videos continue to use `videoStopped`; timer-ended startups use their normal fade path.

`ENCLAVE_PIPBOY.AVI` uses the clean rebuilt media stream that resolved an audio-only/black-video startup case during 1.1.6 testing. Other startup media remains on its previously working encoding.

Runtime APPINFO self-registration and diagnostic PIP-CO logging are not used in the repository/modular build. Registration is handled by `metadata.json`.

## Tested hardware

- The Wand Company Pip-Boy 3000
- Pip-Boy OS 1.1.6 / firmware build 2v29.361
- Repeated startup selection, holotape reopen, and boot-cycle testing across all included startup entries
